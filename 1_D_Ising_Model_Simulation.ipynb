At low temperatures, the spins are all aligned (all spin-up, +1) and the spin-chain is highly ordered. At high temperatures, the stronger thermal excitations can randomly excite and flip individual spins, leading to a very disordered chain (random spin-up and spin-down, +1 or -1).\n",

Additionally the implementation of even a relatively simple Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm was not straight-forward. For more advanced/complicated MCMC methods like No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), such methods may be very difficult and tme-consuming to implement from scratch.\n",

        "\n",
        "(2) extending the total Hamiltonian to also consider the energy from interaction with a non-zero external magnetic field $h$\n",
        "\n",
        "In this regard, the original code simplified the Hamiltonian by ignoring $\\mathscr{H}^{1}_{Ext}$. We modify the function to be able to calculate the energy changes by including this new term in the total 1-D Hamiltonian:\n",

        "We show that our implementation (in a PPL) is much shorter and simpler (in terms of lines of code) than the equivalent non-probabilistic code, with vectorized functions provided under the PyMC3 library removing the need for multiple-nesting of for loops as in the non-probabilistic implementation. The PyMC3 implementation also demonstrates expected features and behaviour for a 1-D Ising Chain, in good agreement with the non-probabilistic implementation above."

        "This behaviour is expected and agrees well with theory, and also the previous non-PPL implementation shown in Section 1. At low temperatures, the spins will largely be aligned with the external magnetic field $h$ with spin = +1, as random thermal excitations are too weak and have low probabiility of flipping the spin during the MCMC chain. At high temperatures the stronger thermal fluctuations/excitations lead to high probability of flipping of the spin-flips during the MCMC chain. Hence the spin-flips will be largely disordered and random at the end."

However given limited manpower/time (as this was a solo project), our results were unconclusive (both showing comparable timings) and would need collection of more data and experiments.\n",

        "Additionally, when testing the PyMC3 implementation, we realised that as the function works by running automatic probailistic inference on at least 2 independent MCMC chains in order to ensure convergence, it was thus doing at least twice the number of MCMC steps versus the non-PPL implementation. Hence our initial runtime tests probably did not evaluate the PPL approach fairly, and more consideration about how to design a fairer runtime comparison test between the non-PPL and PPL approaches is required.\n",

This could be tested by running a fair runtime comparison test between the non-PPL and PPL implementations on a very large 1-D Ising chain, for example one with n_lattice_sites = $10^{3}-10^{5}$, and observe any divergence in runtime scaling."
